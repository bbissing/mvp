There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

Goodwill Trivia Challenge (GTC)

## Sub-Heading ##
> Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

Gracious patrons who like to donate to a good cause and who happen to like trivia.

## Summary ##
> Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

Goodwill Trivia Challenge (GTC) is organization that hosts weekly trivia questions via its website. There are 25 questions total. Whoever gets towards the end without getting two strikes gets to decide where to donate the prize winnings. It can go towards any of the pre-defined charity organizations that GTC sponsors. Additionally, if the user would like to donate some of their own money to the cause, they are welcome to do so. If there are multiple winners, the pool will be split amongst the winners. The prize itself is primarily funded through advertisements.

## Problem ##
> Describe the problem your product solves.

Donating towards a good cause is a great way to give back to the community. However, sometimes, some of us patrons like to offer more than what we're able to afford.

## Solution ##
> Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

GTC allows patrons to donate an external lump sum amount (prize/pool) towards any organization of their choosing. Plus, especially for trivia enthusiasts, they get to have some fun while doing so.

## Quote from You ##
> A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

Goodwill Trivia Challenge (GTC) not only provides a source of fun and engaging content, but it also provides the benefit of self-satisfaction and assuredness knowing that the prize money will be going towards the cause of your choosing.

## How to Get Started ##
> Describe how easy it is to get started.

To get started, all you need to do is create an account and opt-in to get text message notifications. We make sure to send a message to you a day before the next round starts. That said, each round typically starts on Sundays at 1:30 PM (CT). The rounds usually last for 15 minutes. You are allowed one strike. If you get two strikes, you are kicked out from that round. If you make it towards the end, you will be prompted to choose a sponsored charity to donate towards. If you’d like, you can also provide additional funds on top of the prize earnings. After a few days pass, whether you won or lost that round, you’ll be notified when the next round begins. If you decide to not participate any further, you can do so by opting out through text.

## Customer Quote ##
> Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

Not only am I addicted to GTC, but I feel great whenever I win! Knowing that the money is going towards a charity that I care about is just a wonderful feeling. There is only so much I can provide, so it feels good knowing that GTC is able to provide additional resources towards a community that I care so deeply about.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
> Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
